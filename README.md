* [**DevConf Session - Predictive Autoscaling Patterns in Kubernetes**](https://devconfcz2022.sched.com/event/siIn/predictive-autoscaling-patterns-in-kubernetes)

## Abstract

During this workshop we will demonstrate how your applications can benefit from Vertical Pod Autoscaler improving the responsiveness and performance of your workloads in Kubernetes environments.

We will analyze the best practices and deployment patterns to include in an easy way these new features that can be integrated with your applications custom metrics.

After this workshop, you will understand the implementation details and the architecture highlights, freeing your developers from the necessity of setting up-to-date resource limits and requests for the containers in their pods allowing them to focus on their business application development, making possible scale applications in a predictive and efficient way.
